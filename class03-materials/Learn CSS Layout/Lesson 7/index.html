  <h1>position</h1>
  
  <div class="static">
    static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.
  </div>

  <div class="relative1">
    relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.
  </div>

  <div class="relative2">
    Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
  </div>

  <div class="fixed">
    Hello! Don't pay attention to me yet.
  </div>

  <div class="relative">
    This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; its absolutely-positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.

    <div class="absolute">
      This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned relative to its parent.
    </div>
